                    <h5 class="card-title">Welcome on the NMS mapping browser page. This page allows you to browse
                        server-side mappings for Minecraft: Java Edition, and compare different mapping types and
                        versions.</h5>
                    <p>
                        This page mainly focuses on Spigot, its forks, and Spigot-Forge hybrids like MohistMC. That
                        means, that this page doesn't contain information about things excluded in Spigot mappings (e.g.
                        package-info). This page also doesn't contain any information about lambdas, anonymous classes
                        or synthetic members (they are generated by the compiler, they are not in the source code).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the overview page of every version, you can find the licenses for all the mappings and links
                        to their origin.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        If the class or the package name contains ${V}, it means there should be the CraftBukkit version
                        string (e.g. v1_15_R1, v1_16_R3, ...). If you need the string (not using NMSMapper), please
